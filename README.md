How to build

This repository is an Apache Cordova project, missing folders and dependencies will be automatically downloaded and installed when you add a destination platform.

To compile the SCSS to CSS, execute this line from the `www` folder

```
compass watch
```

To generate the application for a new platform (like Android), execute these lines from the root folder

```
cordova platform add android
cordova build android
```
